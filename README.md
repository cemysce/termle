A ~~blatant ripoff~~ loving attempt to faithfully recreate [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)'s gameplay **and** aesthetic... from a terminal.

Credit for the gameplay logic and visual design belongs to [Josh Wardle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/),
but any ingenuity in recreating that visual design using only text belongs to me
_(okay, also the Unicode Consortium and the long history of box-drawing characters, without which this program would look nowhere near as good)_.

The only bit of logic that was replicated from upstream Wordle's JavaScript code is the logic for computing the daily game number and its solution.
Everything else was written from scratch by me to replicate the gameplay logic as I understood it from playing the game.
