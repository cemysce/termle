# termle

A blatant but loving attempt to faithfully recreate [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)'s gameplay **and** aesthetic... from a terminal.

Credit for the game's name, gameplay logic, and visual design belongs to [Josh Wardle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/).

The only bit of logic that was replicated from upstream Wordle's JavaScript code is the logic for computing the daily game number and its solution.
Everything else was written from scratch by me to replicate the gameplay logic as I understood it from playing the game.
